Howdy! I'm Keaton Soll, a motocross racer with a passion for aviation. I've always been fascinated by the freedom and excitement of flying, and I'm interested in a career in either commercial travel or the military. I'm excited to connect with other aviation enthusiasts and learn more about the field.

In addition to motocross, I'm also an experienced scuba diver and snowboarder. I'm always looking for new adventures and challenges, and I'm confident that I can bring the same determination and work ethic to my aviation career.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to connect. I look forward to hearing from you!\
